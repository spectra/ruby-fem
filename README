FEM - File Event Monitor
------------------------

This is just a more elaborate interface on top of inotify (using
Ruby-Inotify[1]) with the purpose of monitoring files in the same way
monitoring directories (not removing the watch everytime a file deletes
itself).

We're not monitoring directories (for that you can always use Inotify
directly). As a bonus, you can define a persist_file so ids are
persisted to a file (we don't persist anything else, though).
